# FreeThrift A Website for Freegans
FreeThrift is a website designed for people who consider themselves serious Freegans or the person that wants to give away gently-used items they no longer need for free. FreeThrift cuts out the need for throwing items out on the street or throwing items that still have use in the dumpster. Instead use FreeThrift to help the environment by allowing someone to use what you no longer can.
